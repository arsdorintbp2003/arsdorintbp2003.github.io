A website to convert normal texts into a book-style vertical writing script. Mostly suitable for poems, especially 
East Asian language poems.
## Some use cases' example:
- Multi-language text processing: The website could convert different language texts, from CJKV texts to 
alphabet scripts (English, French, etc)
  + For CJKV scripts, each character will be displayed in a box, similar to the traditional way.
  + For alphabet scripts, each word will be displayed in a box.
    Users can break a word into hyphens if they need 
  for visualization purposes (e.g., Introduction into "in tro duc tion")
  + Multi-language can be inputted together:

  ![Flower.PNG](images%2FFlower.PNG)
  ![Flower_2.PNG](images%2FFlower_2.PNG)
  Example: Lyrics of the song "Flower" from Jisoo (BLACKPINK) after conversion.
  <br/>
- Poem-style support: The function of tungbay is mostly suitable for East Asian poems in terms of visualization, due to 
the constant number of characters inside each sentence.

  Example: A "thất ngôn" poem (7 characters per sentence).
  <br/>
  + Styles support: Some text-based styles, such as light / bold
  + Poem style (currently adding new styles): Normal Style, Kieu Story Style
    + Kieu Story Style is resembled of 
    ["The Tale of Kieu" (1866 version)'s one,](https://thuonghieuvaphapluat.vn/Images/dinhhieu/2020/09/28/2%20(1).JPG),
    with some small modifications. It is mostly suitable for "lục bát", or 6–8 poem.
